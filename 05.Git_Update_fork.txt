Updating your Fork
==================

It is also important to know why should we update our forks. Because so many users
might be collaborating to the repository you are working and making changes on. I-
n such case you might not know what the changes that have done by the other users.
So if we have enabled upstream then every user can know what the other users have
done to that repository. As enabling upstream will upload the changes made on the-
ir forks will let the other users know the changes.

Adding remote for upstream
--------------------------

	# git remote add upstream <PATH_TO_REPO>
	# git remote add upstream https://github.com/vmsnivas/bss.git
	
Fetch the Changes
-----------------

	# git fetch upstream

Merge them into master
----------------------

	# git merge upstream/master master 

Push the changes
----------------

	# git push origin master
