Working with Single repository
==============================

Most of the times we should not like to keep going with forking and work on the repositories.
Because there might be lot of headaches to manage those. Sometimes it will going to be a hea-
dache. To avoid this a group of users can collaborate to a single repo by cloning and working
locally. But sometimes it will also become a headache if every user is directly pushing their
changes to the master branch. To avoid this users can work on branches after they have compl-
eted then they can generate a pull request stating the changes they have made. If the owner 
of the repo thinks the changes are good to go then he can directly merge to the master branch.
