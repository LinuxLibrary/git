Working on Pull requests and Branches
=====================================

As we learnt that it would be always a good idea to work on branches and
stop working on the master we'll need to generate a pull request once we
are good to go with our code. So let us see how to work on branches.

Create a branch:

	# git branch feature1

Switch to the new branch:

	# git checkout feature1

Now add some files to that branch and commit. After that generate a pull 
request. From the main user try to review the changes and accept or rej-
ect that pull request.
