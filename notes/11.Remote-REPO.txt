# Create a remote repository

We can create repositories from our local machine.
For this we need to use the GitHub API. We need to curl the API and provide the username and repo name.
curl -u <USER_NAME> https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"<REPO_NAME>"}'

After this we can clone this repo into our local machine and wok on it as usually.

git clone git+ssh://git@github.com/<ACCOUNT_NAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git
