Git Pull Request
================

When ever we forked another users repository and if we want to collaborate
with them we can generate a pull request. After forking and cloning to our
local computer if we do changes or some new codes have been added to the
repository locally the same will be taking effect to the main repository
as well. If we need these changes to made permanent to that repository as
well then we need to generate a Pull request. Which will be notified to t-
he owner of the main repository. After reviewing that person can accept or
reject that request. If that request has been accepted then our changes w-
ill be merged to the main repository and committed.

	To do this we need to login to our git account in the WebUI after
that click on the "Pull Request" button and there after click on "Create
Pull Request" button enter some info regarding the pull and click on "Sen-
d Pull Request" button.
